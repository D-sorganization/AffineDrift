# Current Technical Review Checkpoint — #4425

Branch `fix/induced-acceleration-rigor` starts at putting PR head d3bc7d76.
SELF saves complete reads of both Chapter30b sources, primary-source preparation
and eight new independent checks (19 with existing superposition cases), all
passing. Chapter sources are not edited yet. Issue4425 is a native subissue of
4054; lease/presence expire23:44UTC September22. See technical-review/
induced-acceleration-preparation.md for the intended derivations and access scope.

Putting regular PR4424 is open at d3bc7d76; source/render evidence is frozen at
a17f5ded. Preserve that binding. Force4421 merged as9ef76c6e; deployment35787101015
is still building. Verify force live publication before enabling putting merge;
then verify putting's own live result. Save successor publication evidence on
this branch. Do not interrupt active publication by merging the successor early.

Disk headroom was approximately96MB after removing six older untracked,
reproducible research downloads. The complete putting checkpoint was preserved.
Check headroom before downloading or rendering; do not discard user files.
The comprehensive review remains active; regular PRs only.

# Current Technical Review Checkpoint — #4422

Branch `fix/putting-roll-rigor` begins at force head 4047d917. SELF saves
the full putting rewrite, 15 independent passing numerical checks and four
production browser cases. Detailed equation/overview QA passes: all168 math expressions in four cases,
28 inspected desktop equations, all table contents, expanded accessibility and
scroll endpoints. SELF saves the complete scientific/render checkpoint before binding. Issue #4422 is claimed under #4059/#4021/#4009.
Lease/presence expire 23:09 UTC September 22. Inbox has no reported messages
or conflicts but is incomplete because of unrelated malformed board records.
See `technical-review/putting-roll-preparation.md` for derivations, source
access limits and the next steps. The route is reviewed with seven findings bound to complete checkpoint
a17f5ded. All five evidence paths match committed LF bytes; zero-deferred census
is restored. Final33 audit/mechanics checks pass; regular PR #4424 is open. Drive
protected checks and wait for force publication before enabling merge.

Delivery: superposition #4419 is shipped at 31cdc615; deploy 35782578807
and live artifact 10720600549 passed 960/960 cases. Publication record saved. Force #4421 merged as 9ef76c6e after all protected checks passed. Its tree
matches 4047d917 exactly; normal merge of origin/main retains the later putting
turnover where squash ancestry repeated predecessor text. Deployment35787101015
is pending. Save its publication record independently of frozen scientific evidence. Do not alter
force-bound files at 99d1653c; the putting article may reuse its scoped CSS.

The comprehensive review goal remains active. No draft PRs.

A disk-full event interrupted the first audit binding attempt. The committed
inventory was restored, six untracked reproducible research PDF downloads were
removed within this worktree, and binding was repeated with an atomic file
replacement. No tracked source or frozen evidence was lost. Disk headroom
remains low; monitor before additional rendering.

The following previously merged persona-work handoff is retained for its
separate scope; it is not the active technical-review task.

# Implementation Handoff — #4409

- Repository: `D-sorganization/AffineDrift`
- Working directory: `/workspace`
- Branch: `cursor/persona-start-paths-394f` (base `origin/main`)
- Pull request: https://github.com/D-sorganization/AffineDrift/pull/4411
- Governing issue: `#4409` (Persona start paths on learning-paths)
- Current HEAD: `d3b8e438`

## Objective and Status

- Objective: Add persona start paths (learner / researcher / integrator / experimentalist / reviewer / contributor) to `resources/learning-paths.qmd`, each routing to content clusters and exact-commit workflow pages.
- Status: **Implementation complete, awaiting CI**
- All local tests pass (14 persona tests + emoji heading test)
- CI workflows not triggering for commits after initial push (GitHub Actions issue)

## Completed Work

1. Created `config/personas.yml` with persona definitions:
   - 6 personas: learner, researcher, integrator, experimentalist, reviewer, contributor
   - Each maps to content clusters (from categories.yml)
   - Each maps to exact-commit workflows (from workflows.qmd)

2. Updated `resources/learning-paths.qmd`:
   - Added "Start by Persona" section with resource cards
   - Links to content clusters and workflow pages
   - No emojis in headings (repo style requirement)

3. Created `tests/test_persona_start_paths.py`:
   - 14 contract tests validating persona configuration
   - Tests pass locally

4. Updated `SPEC.md` with change-log row

5. Regenerated claim audit evidence

## Files Changed

- `config/personas.yml` (new)
- `resources/learning-paths.qmd` (modified)
- `tests/test_persona_start_paths.py` (new)
- `SPEC.md` (modified)
- `data/trust/claim_audit_inventory.json` (modified)
- `data/trust/generated/claim_audit_report.json` (modified)

## Validation (Local)

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_persona_start_paths.py -v  # 14 passed
python3 -m pytest tests/test_formatting_lints.py::TestEmojiConsistency::test_learning_paths_headings_emoji_free -v  # passed
python3 -m ruff check tests/test_persona_start_paths.py  # passed
python3 -m black --check --line-length 100 tests/test_persona_start_paths.py  # passed
```

## Known Issue

- GitHub Actions workflows not triggering for commits after initial push
- First CI run (commit ca1db05f) completed with failures (expected - pre-fix code)
- Subsequent commits (aa45dcad, 2cf79129, 8b62f79e, d3b8e438) have not triggered CI
- This appears to be a GitHub Actions service issue

## Next Steps

1. Wait for GitHub Actions to recover and trigger CI for latest commit
2. Once CI passes, arm squash auto-merge
3. If CI continues to fail to trigger, may need to create a new PR
