# Current Technical Review Checkpoint — #4412

The user resumed the full technical review on 2026-09-22. Canonical technical
review continuation is in `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, section Technical Content Review,
and `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, DL-#4412. Branch
`fix/technical-review-resume`, checkpoint SELF, regular PR #4414. The paired
Chapter 22 scientific revision and local numerical/print/browser checks are
complete. Source/evidence commit `14f1c1481530f8cf05d20539e18b5c2b19f836ce`
is pushed and bound in the inventory. Chapter 16's bibliography/reading-links
carry-forward preserves its prior scientific review. Protected checks, merge
and exact-main publication remain pending. CI figure-census failures were
reproduced and the counts corrected for the removed unpaired anatomy sketch. See
`reports/technical-review/anatomy-joint-review.md` for the argument and source
boundaries. Issue #4413 tracks the next preface review.

The following previously merged persona-work handoff is retained for its
separate scope; it is not the active technical-review task.

# Implementation Handoff — #4409

- Repository: `D-sorganization/AffineDrift`
- Working directory: `/workspace`
- Branch: `cursor/persona-start-paths-394f` (base `origin/main`)
- Pull request: https://github.com/D-sorganization/AffineDrift/pull/4411
- Governing issue: `#4409` (Persona start paths on learning-paths)
- Current HEAD: `d3b8e438`

## Objective and Status

- Objective: Add persona start paths (learner / researcher / integrator / experimentalist / reviewer / contributor) to `resources/learning-paths.qmd`, each routing to content clusters and exact-commit workflow pages.
- Status: **Implementation complete, awaiting CI**
- All local tests pass (14 persona tests + emoji heading test)
- CI workflows not triggering for commits after initial push (GitHub Actions issue)

## Completed Work

1. Created `config/personas.yml` with persona definitions:
   - 6 personas: learner, researcher, integrator, experimentalist, reviewer, contributor
   - Each maps to content clusters (from categories.yml)
   - Each maps to exact-commit workflows (from workflows.qmd)

2. Updated `resources/learning-paths.qmd`:
   - Added "Start by Persona" section with resource cards
   - Links to content clusters and workflow pages
   - No emojis in headings (repo style requirement)

3. Created `tests/test_persona_start_paths.py`:
   - 14 contract tests validating persona configuration
   - Tests pass locally

4. Updated `SPEC.md` with change-log row

5. Regenerated claim audit evidence

## Files Changed

- `config/personas.yml` (new)
- `resources/learning-paths.qmd` (modified)
- `tests/test_persona_start_paths.py` (new)
- `SPEC.md` (modified)
- `data/trust/claim_audit_inventory.json` (modified)
- `data/trust/generated/claim_audit_report.json` (modified)

## Validation (Local)

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_persona_start_paths.py -v  # 14 passed
python3 -m pytest tests/test_formatting_lints.py::TestEmojiConsistency::test_learning_paths_headings_emoji_free -v  # passed
python3 -m ruff check tests/test_persona_start_paths.py  # passed
python3 -m black --check --line-length 100 tests/test_persona_start_paths.py  # passed
```

## Known Issue

- GitHub Actions workflows not triggering for commits after initial push
- First CI run (commit ca1db05f) completed with failures (expected - pre-fix code)
- Subsequent commits (aa45dcad, 2cf79129, 8b62f79e, d3b8e438) have not triggered CI
- This appears to be a GitHub Actions service issue

## Next Steps

1. Wait for GitHub Actions to recover and trigger CI for latest commit
2. Once CI passes, arm squash auto-merge
3. If CI continues to fail to trigger, may need to create a new PR
